## What is PhpStorm Borderless?

**PhpStorm Borderless** is a specialized tool that allows developers to run PhpStorm in **borderless windowed mode**, eliminating distractions and improving workflow efficiency. Unlike traditional fullscreen modes that can cause delays when switching between applications, borderless mode ensures smooth transitions and uninterrupted multitasking.

With PhpStorm Borderless, developers can enjoy:
- Seamless switching between IDE and browser, terminal, or documentation.
- A clean, borderless interface that maximizes screen real estate.
- Enhanced focus for coding, debugging, and testing.
- Ideal for pair programming, streaming, or presenting code.

This tool is especially useful for **PHP developers**, **web programmers**, and **full-stack engineers** who rely on PhpStorm for their daily work. By removing borders and enabling true borderless windowed mode, it helps maintain flow state and productivity.

PhpStorm Borderless is open-source, free, and compatible with modern Windows systems. It’s the perfect addition to any developer’s toolkit.
